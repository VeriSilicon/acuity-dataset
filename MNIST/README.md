LeCun et al. (1999): The MNIST Dataset Of Handwritten Digits (Images)

The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

See http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist for more information.

Note

The version that is offered here is identical to the four files distributed there, but has been converted into a single HDF5 file than can easily be read by PyMVPA.
